  92–122 & –     & In the single known source \B1, violins and trombones pause
                   in this movement. However, it is highly likely that a
                   solo instrument has been lost during the creation of
                   the manuscript copy. Thus, addition of, e.\,g.,
                   a trombone solo is left as an exercise
                   for the period performer. \\
