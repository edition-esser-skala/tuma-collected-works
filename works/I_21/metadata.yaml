  –   & –    & Although this work has been transmitted as a trio
               for vl and cemb, it is equally likely that the original work
               was a sonata for two vl and continuo. In this case,
               the known sources would represent an arrangement.
               To facilitate performance with the possibly original scoring,
               bass figures have been added in all bars by the editor.
               (In \B1, bass figures only appear in bars 77–81 and 227–235.) \\
