  – & –   & org  & \B1 is the only extant source of this mass, and its org part has been lost. Thus, bass figures in this edition have been added by the editor, as have all notes in treble clef. \\

    & 176–232 & – & In \B1, a solo instrument is most likely missing in this movement. Since trb 1 does not contain a directive “Quoniam tacet” (as found in trb 2), and an original part heading on fol.~1r has been replaced by “Trombone Primo Rip:”, there may have been a solo for trb~1, which was for an unknown reason lost during the copying process. Alternatively, since the org part is missing in \B1, this movement may have also comprised a solo for org. In any case, addition of a suitable solo is left as an exercise for the period performer. \\
