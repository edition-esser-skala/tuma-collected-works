  – & –     & org  & The org part of the single known extant source \B1
                     has been lost. Thus, bass figures in this edition
                     have been added by the editor, as have all notes
                     in treble clef. \\
  1 & 53    & S    & last \eighthNote\ in \B1: b′16–c″16 \\
  2 & 9     & vl 2 & 3rd \quarterNote\ in \B1: f″8.–e″32–f″32 \\
    & 11    & trb 1, A & 2nd \eighthNote\ in \B1: g′8 \\
    & 37    & org  & 1st \quarterNote\ in \B1: c′8.–b32–c′32 \\
    & 70    & org  & 4th \eighthNote\ in \B1: d8 \\
    & 71    & vl 2 & 3rd to 5th \eighthNote\ in \B1: d′8–b8–d′8 \\
    & 131   & vl 2 & 2nd \eighthNote\ in \B1: g′8 \\
    & 149   & org  & bar in \B1: G2. \\
    & 176–232 & –  & In \B1, a solo instrument is most likely missing in this
                     movement. Since trb~1 does not contain a directive
                     “Quoniam tacet” (as found in trb~2), and since an original
                     part heading on fol.~1r has been replaced by
                     “Trombone Primo Rip:”, there may have been a solo
                     for trb~1, which was lost during the copying process.
                     Alternatively, since the org part is missing in \B1,
                     this movement may have also comprised a solo for org.
                     In any case, addition of a suitable solo
                     is left as an exercise for the period performer. \\
    & 183   & org  & 1st \quarterNote\ in \B1: d4 \\
  3 & 2–13  & vl, org & Slurs in \B1 are often written ambiguously.
                     Hence, they might alternatively connect only the last
                     two \sixteenthNote\ in a group of three. \\
    & 16    & vl 2 & 8th \sixteenthNote\ in \B1: a′16 \\
    & 17    & org  & 3rd \eighthNote\ in \B1: B8 \\
    & 71–73 & org  & upper voice addded by editor \\
    & 73    & org  & 2nd \quarterNote\ in \B1: d4 \\
    & 87f   & org  & upper voice addded by editor \\
