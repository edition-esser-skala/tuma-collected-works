  154–165 & –  & The missing instrumental accompaniment in bars 156, 158,
                 160, and 163–165 possibly indicates that originally,
                 the scoring also comprised two trombones (as would be
                 typical for Tůma’s compositions from this period),
                 which were lost during the copying process. \\
